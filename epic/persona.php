		<p>On my free time I like to go hiking and swimming. I work part time
			as an office assistant at a legal attorney office. During the remainder
			of my time I work on writing music, and making videos of my talent.
			I love to post on Facebook because it is always free and all of my
			closest family and friends get to see what I am working on. Everyone is
			always so encouraging and constantly commenting great things about me.
