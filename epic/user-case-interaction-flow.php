	Before Adeleah began using facebook to promote herself, she
	would only record herself on her personal devices such as
	her android cell phone. And only her closest of family
	knew about her beautiful voice. It never went any further than
	her own living room.
</p>

<p>
	After she began integrating facebook she was able to upload
	her content to her personal profile and news feed. Soon
	her family began to click the "like" and "share" button.
	It began getting viewed by their circle of influence and so on.
	Eventually Adeleah began getting noticed by small/local bars
	and was asked to perform on special nights. It allowed her
	to get out of her confort zone and gain more exposure.
